// What is tokio, and why is it used in Rust?

// How does tokio enable asynchronous programming in Rust?
// How do async and await work with tokio?
// Can you explain the difference between blocking and non-blocking functions in Rust?
// How does tokio::spawn() work, and why is it used in an async context?

// What does tokio::spawn() do, and what type of value does it return?
// Why would you use tokio::spawn() instead of just calling a function directly?

// What is join_all() in futures and how does it work?

// What does futures::join_all() do when passed a collection of futures?
// How can you use join_all() to wait for multiple async tasks to complete?
// Can you give an example where you spawn several tasks and use join_all() to await their completion?

// What is the advantage of using Box<dyn Fn> with Arc<Mutex<T>> in a multi-threaded application?
// What challenges might arise when combining dynamic dispatch (Box<dyn Fn>) and shared state (Arc<Mutex<T>>) in a concurrent environment?
// How does Rustâ€™s ownership and borrowing system help ensure safe access to shared data?
// Can you create a small example that uses all of these concepts to build a multi-threaded task scheduler?
